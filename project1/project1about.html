         <p class="intropara"> My name is Brian you, I was born into a family that grew up in the mountian side of china but came to american in the early 2000s.
            I was born and raised in New york queens where I spent most of my childhood as a indoor person. I moved before my middle school year
            to bayside and have since been living there. My parents oridinary wanted me to go to china when I was very little but under some issues,
            I didn't get the chance to go to china. My parents wants to take me someday back to china and I wanted to learn more about china so I 
            figured why now look at one of china's largest cities.
