        <p class="intropara">When Shanghai was first founded, it was a small fishing village and market town located near Yangzi river. It started to turn into a county capital
            during the times of the yuan dynasty. It turned into a trading port after the events of the opium war. By the time world war 2 arrived, it was  under the control of japan.
            This event brough about a time of conflict and hardships. By the time we reached modern years, Shanghai became a cosmopolitan city and a imporatnt major city in china.
